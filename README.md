# Snake
This is my take on the classic Nokia game, snake. Written in Python 3.10, I made it as part of Angela Yu's "100 Days 
of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" class on Udemy.

## Gameplay
The game is simple. One starts out with a three-segment snake (a white rectangle) and moves forward. The player presses the 
arrow-keys to turn the snake's head, and the body follows after. The aim of the game is to score as many points as possible.
One scores points by directing his sanke to "eat" as many pieces of "food" as possible. The food is a green circle on the 
screeen, and one eats that piece of food by running directly into it. Every time the snake eats a piece of food, the player 
gains a point (recorded at the top of the screen) and the snake grows one segment longer. The game ends when the snake hits 
the walls of the game or hits its own tail.
